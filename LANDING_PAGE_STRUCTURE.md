## Everything Else You're Wondering

**Subheadline:** We've answered these questions 4,782 times. Here they are in one place.

---

**Column 1:**

**Q1: Is this actually AI or just templates?**
**A:** It's real AI. Trained on 10 million thumbnails. Every design is generated fresh based on your input. We don't use templates that 500 other creators are using. Your thumbnail is unique to you.

**Q2: Will my thumbnails look like everyone else's?**
**A:** No. That's the whole point. The AI generates unique designs based on YOUR idea, YOUR style preferences, and YOUR niche. Even if two people type the same prompt, they'll get different results.

**Q3: Do I need design experience?**
**A:** Zero. If you can type, you can use Youbnail. The AI handles composition, color theory, contrast, hierarchy — all the design stuff you'd learn in 4 years of design school.

**Q4: How long does it take to generate a thumbnail?**
**A:** 3 seconds. We timed it. Type your idea. Hit generate. Count to three. Done.

**Q5: Can I edit the thumbnails after they're generated?**
**A:** Yes. Change text, swap colors, adjust styles. Or regenerate entirely. You're in control.

**Q6: What video formats do you support for snapshot extraction?**
**A:** MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM. If you can upload it to YouTube, we can extract frames from it.

**Q7: Do you store my videos?**
**A:** No. We extract the frames you need, then delete the video immediately. Privacy matters.

**Q8: Can I use Youbnail for client work?**
**A:** Yes. Starter and Pro plans include commercial licenses. Create thumbnails for clients, courses, agencies — whatever you need.

---

**Column 2:**

**Q9: What makes this better than Canva or Photoshop?**
**A:** Speed and intelligence. Canva gives you templates. Photoshop gives you tools. Youbnail gives you AI that understands what works. Plus, we're built specifically for YouTube thumbnails. Not flyers. Not Instagram posts. Thumbnails.

**Q10: I'm not a YouTuber. Can I still use this?**
**A:** Absolutely. Course creators, marketers, social media managers, agencies — anyone who needs attention-grabbing visuals can use Youbnail.

**Q11: Do you integrate with YouTube?**
**A:** Not yet. But it's on the roadmap. For now, you download the thumbnail and upload it manually to YouTube (takes 5 seconds).

**Q12: What if I don't like any of the generated options?**
**A:** Regenerate. Different prompt. Different style. Try again. With Starter plan, you get unlimited generations. Keep going until you find the one that makes you say "YES."

**Q13: Is my data secure?**
**A:** Yes. 256-bit encryption. We don't sell data. We don't share data. We barely look at data. Your thumbnails are yours.

**Q14: Can multiple people use one account?**
**A:** Free and Starter plans are single-user. Pro plan supports up to 5 team members with collaboration features.

**Q15: What if I need help?**
**A:** Free users get email support (24-48 hour response). Starter users get priority support (< 2 hour response). Pro users get a dedicated account manager. Plus, we have a knowledge base, video tutorials, and community forums.

**Q16: Do you offer student or non-profit discounts?**
**A:** Yes. Email us with proof of student status or 501(c)(3) documentation. We'll hook you up with 50% off Starter plan.
